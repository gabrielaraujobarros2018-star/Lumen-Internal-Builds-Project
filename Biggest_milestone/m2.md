## M2 Completion Note

Milestone M2 marks the start of a **new era** in the Lumen ecosystem—completed February 14 after 19 days of intense development (started January 26).

This massive build evolved far beyond early <1-day experiments through:
- Kernel/bootchain solidification on Moto Nexus 6 (ARMv7a)
- Directory overhaul and monster file creation
- Linux kernel + PKern (emergency) integration
- Rebrand from PalisadeOS → Lumen
- Palikey keyboard, first font (Handwritten Landspace), userland (clipboard)
- M3 blueprints locked in (frameworks, GUI evolution)

**No abandonment.** Pressure builds resilience—Lumen fights boredom. I'm made to code. Afternoon M3 launch incoming.
